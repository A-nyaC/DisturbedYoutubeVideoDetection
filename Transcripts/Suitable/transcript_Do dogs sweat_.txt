around a dog, you might know", "that they can get zoomies
when they're excited", "or after they've taken a bath
or even when they're bored.", 'Zoomies are a great way for
dogs to get rid of extra energy.', "Looks tiring, doesn't it?", 'Someone named Benny is curious about dogs.', "Let's give Benny a call now.", '(phone ringing)', '- Hi Esther.', '- Hi Benny.', '- I have a question for you.', 'Do dogs sweat?', "- That's a great question.", 'When dogs go on long walks or play outside', 'in the summer sun or do zoomies,
they can get pretty hot.', 'I mean, imagine if we did zoomies.', "We'd get hot too and probably
get sweaty, but why is that?", "Before I go on, I'm curious.", "Why do you think we sweat when it's hot?", 'Now would be a good time to
pause the video and discuss.', 'Okay, you ready?', "If you've ever gone swimming,
you might already have a clue", "as to why we sweat when we're hot.", 'Think about it for a second.', 'Have you ever hopped out of a pool or lake', 'and felt your wet skin
get really cold even', 'when it was hot outside?', 'Maybe you even started to shiver.', 'Burr.', 'That chill you feel is
because of the water drying.', "When water dries off your skin,
it doesn't just disappear.", 'It actually turns into an invisible gas', 'and moves into the air, and
when it does, it takes some', 'of the heat from your
body into the air with it.', 'When water turns into a gas like that,', 'we call it evaporation.', 'And evaporation is what
makes us feel cooler', 'when we get wet.', "Okay, but what if there's no pool", 'or lake or hose around to get wet?', 'How are we supposed to cool off then?', 'This is where sweat comes in.', 'Sweat is one of the main
ways a human stays cool.', 'We make sweat all over
our bodies when we get hot', 'and when that wet sweat
evaporates into the air,', 'it takes heat with it and
cools us off just like the lake', 'or pool water does when it
evaporates off our skin.', 'So is sweat how dogs cool off too?', 'Well, yes and no.', "Dogs can sweat like humans
do, but here's the thing,", "they can't make sweat all
over their bodies like us.", "This is the bottom of a dog's paw.", 'See those pads?', "That's one of the only
places dogs can sweat.", 'Now, sweaty paws can help keep a dog cool,', 'but only a little.', 'I mean, look at these paws.', 'Not very big compared to the
rest of its body, are they?', "The sweat that comes from a dog's paw", 'is definitely not enough
to keep a dog cool.', 'In fact, some animal experts think', 'that sweaty paw help the
dog grip the ground more', 'than they help the dog keep cool.', "Okay, so if sweat doesn't
keep a dog's body very cool,", 'what does?', "I'll give you a clue.", 'Check out this dog.', "Can you tell that it's hot?", 'How do you know?', "Yep, it's panting.", 'And panting is one of the
main ways a dog stays cool.', "Look at the inside of this dog's mouth.", "It's pretty wet.", 'You might have noticed
this with dogs you know.', "Dog's mouths and throats
are wet with saliva", 'and when they open their
mouths wide like that,', "they're letting some of
that wet saliva evaporate.", 'And when it does, you guessed it.', 'It takes some of their body heat with it,', 'the same way our sweat
does when it evaporates', 'and that cools a dog down.', "But panting isn't the
only way a dog stays cool.", 'On really warm days, we may
need to help them out a little.', "No, we can't make our dogs paw sweat more", 'or make them pant more.', 'But there are things that we
can do to help a dog stay cool.', 'Like if you ever go out
and play fetch with a dog,', 'you can make sure to carry their ball', 'or stick home for them.', "Dogs can't really pant with a ball", 'or stick in their mouth can they?', 'So carrying their toys home allows them', 'to pant all they want
and helps them stay cool.', "It's also important to make sure", 'that dogs have shade and
cool water on hot days.', "Oh, and if it's really hot
outside, take them on walks", "in the morning or at
night when it's cooler.", 'So in summary, dogs do sweat on their paws', "but that doesn't really
cool them off much.", 'So they have to rely on
other ways to cool off', 'like panting.', "When a dog pants, it's letting the water", 'in its mouth and throat
evaporate into the air', 'taking some of the heat with it.', 'That way it can cool down and
zoom around the house again.', "That's all for this week's lesson.", 'Thanks Benny for asking it.', 'Now for the next episode, we reached', 'into the question jar and
picked out three questions sent', "into us that we're thinking
about answering next.", "When this video's done playing,", "you'll get to vote on one.", 'You can choose from who invented zippers?', 'How does hail form?', 'Or how do astronauts get ready for space?', 'So submit your vote
