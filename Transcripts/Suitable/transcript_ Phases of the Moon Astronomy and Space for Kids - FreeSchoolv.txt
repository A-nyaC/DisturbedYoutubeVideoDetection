"You're watching FreeSchool!", "It's the brightest and most noticeable object\nin the night sky, but if you spend much time", 'observing it, you will see that the moon is\nnever quite the same from one night to the', 'next.', "The moon has something we call 'phases,' which\nmeans that it appears to change shape a little", 'bit every night. To understand why this happens,\nwe need to talk a little bit about the way', 'the Earth and the moon move together in space.', 'The moon orbits around the Earth, much like\nthe Earth orbits the sun. However, while the', 'Earth takes about 365 days to travel once\naround the sun - one year - the moon completes', 'its orbit around the Earth in only 29 and\na half days - or about one month.', "That's actually where the idea of months came\nfrom - the time it takes for the moon to complete", "one orbit around the Earth - and the words\n'moon' and 'month' come from the same root.", 'Despite how bright it looks in the sky, the\nmoon does not have any light of its own. It', 'only appears to shine brightly in the sky\nbecause light from the sun hits it and bounces', 'off. Just like the Earth, the moon has a day\nside and a night side, with half of it in', 'sunlight and half of it in darkness at any\none time. As the moon travels through its', 'orbit around the Earth, that dividing line\nbetween day and night, called the terminator,', 'is visible from different angles, giving the\nimpression that different amounts of the moon', 'are lit up on different days.', "The cycle of lunar phases begins with the\n'new moon.' At new moon, the moon appears", 'completely dark because the unlit side is\nfacing the Earth. New moon is the only time', 'in the lunar cycle when a solar eclipse could\nhappen, because it is the only time that the', 'moon is between the sun and the Earth.', 'After a few days, once the moon has moved\nalong a little in its orbit, we can begin', "to see some of the moon's day side from Earth.\nWhat we see is just a thin slice of light,", "called a crescent. We call it a 'waxing crescent,'\nbecause 'waxing' means 'growing.' The crescent", 'moon will grow a little bit thicker every\nnight until it reaches the next phase: first', 'quarter.', 'The first quarter moon is sometimes called\nthe half moon because it appears to us that', "half of the moon is illuminated, but it is\ncalled 'first quarter' because the moon is", 'one-quarter of the way through its cycle.', 'As the days pass, the moon continues to grow,\nsoon entering its next phase, the waxing gibbous.', "Gibbous means 'humped' or 'swollen,' and again,\nwe call it waxing because it grows thicker", 'every night until it reaches the next phase,\nthe full moon.', 'A full moon is the biggest, brightest, and\neasiest phase of the moon to see. The moon', "rises at sunset and is up all night, so if\nyou are outside and the sky is clear, it's", 'hard to miss. The moon is halfway through\nits orbit around the Earth, and is now on', 'the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.\nDuring a full moon is the only time that a', "lunar eclipse can happen, because that is\nthe only time that the Earth's shadow could", 'fall on the moon.', 'As the moon continues in its path, it appears\nto shrink again as we begin to see more and', 'more of its dark side. A few days after the\nfull moon the moon will be a gibbous again,', "but this time it's a waning gibbous. 'Waning'\nmeans shrinking, or getting smaller, and so", 'the moon will be waning for the rest of its\norbit.', "The next phase is another half moon, but this\ntime it's called 'third quarter' or sometimes", "'last' or 'final' quarter, because the moon\nis three-quarters of the way through its orbit.", 'Soon the half moon shrinks into a waning crescent,\nwhich will continue to shrink night after', 'night until it vanishes completely into the\nnext new moon.', 'Big and bright and beautiful, different every\nnight but repeating the same cycle over and', 'over, the moon is one of the best objects\nin the sky to observe, especially for someone', 'just getting started. The next time you look\nup and see the moon in the sky, take a moment', "and see if you can identify which phase of\nthe moon you're seeing, and try to figure", 'out which one will come next.'
