"I'm setting off on a 
journey around the world", 'to follow the butterfly effect.', 'I want to see how even a single
action on one side of the globe', 'can have a profound 
environmental impact on the other.', 'My journey begins in Germany,', 'with a family rewilding their
garden as a fun hobby,', 'showing us that there are
easy and surprising ways', 'we can all make a difference.', 'The common dandelions
they plant can actually kickstart', 'a series of positive ecological events.', 'As the dandelions spread, 
they lead to a boost', 'in a diverse range of insects', 'including the Marmalade Hoverfly.', 'These Marmalade Hoverflies', 'migrate thousands of miles
 every year to warmer climates,', ' 
including Switzerland,', 'where Will Hawkes studies
insect migrations around the world.', 'As they move from flower to flower,', 'they boost plant growth and 
attract even more insects,', 'creating a rich feeding ground
for an unlikely planetary hero,', 'the Pipistrelle bat,', 'known for consuming 
large quantities of insects.', 'Many Pipistrelle bats’ migratory paths', 'take them take them through
Europe, towards Spain. ', 'Here in the Ebro Delta Bat Reserve,', 'bat houses were erected to attract
and support Pipistrelle bats,', 'who each consume thousands
of insects every night,', 'creating an agricultural
alternative to harmful pesticides. ', 'This fascinating approach has been 
adopted far beyond the Ebro Delta', 'informing preservation efforts 
on the other side of the planet.', 'Juliana Senawi is at the centre
of a significant preservation project', "in Malaysia's mangroves.", 'Here, cave nectar and
fruit bats, or flying foxes', ' are the primary pollinators
of many mangrove species.', 'Mangroves’ dense growth 
and complex root systems', 'form a first line of defence against 
erosion, flooding and tsunamis.', 'This natural barricade also benefits', 'local fishermen and their communities.', 'It just goes to show', 'that it only takes the smallest of seeds', 'to help towards growing a more 
beautiful and more resilient', 'natural world.', 'Meanwhile, in the Atlantic 
Forest in South America,', 'another rewilding story is taking shape.', 'In 2020, Zurich Insurance began a
collaboration with nonprofit Instituto Terra', 'to help restore an almost destroyed 
part of this ancient rainforest. ', 'The Zurich Forest Project supports
the planting of one million', 'carefully selected
seedlings over eight years,', 'leading to more flowers, insects, 
birds and even wild cats,', 'whilst also improving the lives
of local communities,', 'including 200 new local conservationists', 'who are being trained as the next
generation of forest protectors.', 'So whether you are planting a 
dandelion in your garden,', 'or part of regenerating
a forest in Brazil,', 'we all have a part to play', 'in supporting nature today to encourage
a more resilient, natural world ', 'tomorrow.'
