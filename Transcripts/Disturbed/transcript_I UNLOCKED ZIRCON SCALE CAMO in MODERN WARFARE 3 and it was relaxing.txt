door I', "immediately leave the area once we're at", 'like over 90% And then I just stand', 'outside uh on the corner and just Farm', 'whatever door they come out so the', 'reason you get it to like 80 90% is', 'because it increases the spawn rate', 'overall for all of the total enemies', 'that could be here see they all start', 'spawning inside once you hit 90 so since', "we're getting close

minutes left I did that in', 'less than 10 minutes although I I mean I', 'did get a good spawn I immediately had a', 'crystal I have 5.9k I would have', 'upgraded a couple minutes ago around the',

gets less and less', 'obviously the further you go less and', "less likely you'll find something you", "haven't completed yet wait is there a", 'UFC event tonight let me throw this hold', "on no there isn't for some reason I", 'thought there was nice thing is being', 'able to plate and shoot at the same time', 'could you always do that and also even', 'if we get in trouble we still have an O', '[\xa0__\xa0] button with our ability yeah this', 'is basically the entire zombies', 'experience for camo grinding anyway', "obviously there's a whole lot more with", 'like the tier three and stuff like that', 'and story missions and whatever but I', "straight up haven't done any of that I", "still don't have a second insured slot I", "haven't finished act one I haven't done", 'anything can the dog stop being so', "offensively quick there's another ziron", 'scale yeah we could easily go for a', "third one but we'd have to find it and I", "don't feel like looking I'd rather just", 'restart the game instead of wasting my', "time you don't have to complete it you", 'could just like cancel the contract all', 'together if you wanted I guess but I', 'like finishing just in case any rewards',

cooking like', "crazy over on 2024 and they've actually", 'had a full four years so hey if [\xa0__\xa0] is', "incomplete it's by Design I'm just", 'saying they actually had four years this', 'time we got the striker and the Rival', "done that game so I didn't just unlock a", 'couple ziron scales last night with it', 'being able to be done like this I', 'actually unlocked here hold on let me',

to", 'starting the serpent tonight challenges', 'which is basically just kill special', 'zombies and all you have to do at that', 'point is just do like escort missions', "tier one tier two it doesn't really", 'matter it might take a little longer', 'than just 300 kills but maybe maybe not', 'it it really depends but it is still', 'simple you just find the contract and go', "and kill them even if you can't find the", "contract there's still a lot of", 'different ways to kill special zombies', "there's a lot of different ways that", "they spawn it's just the escort missions", 'are probably the best way to do it and', 'then eventually we get to this Borealis', 'which looks absolutely gorgeous so next', 'up did we do the Swarm yet wsp swarm', "nope we haven't done the Swarm yet so", 'swarm is next again thank you guys so', 'much for all the love and support on all', 'these videos zombies multiplayer all', "that stuff it's been je guys", 'later'
