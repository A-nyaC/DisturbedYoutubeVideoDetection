percentage', 'than that 85% 90% of the challenges in', 'the tier one zone so there are multiple', 'ways I know how to get to them obviously', 'I mean I killed five of them so the', 'first way that I knew was doing', 'contracts every time you pick up a', 'bounty contract you have a chance to go', 'and get a Mangler a mimic or a disciple', 'I know this because one of my first', 'contracts that I ever did was actually a', 'disciple also however the Bounty mobs', 'that you end up fighting are', 'significantly stronger than one that', 'like you would just find out in the open', 'somewhere or one

going to", "work it's going to be my first time", "doing it now the way that I've been", 'getting them recently was by going into', "tier 2 and grabbing bounties and you're", 'more likely to get

spawns on', 'for the zombies here I usually keep it', 'on there until it breaks the egg open I', "I don't know if that guarantees they're", "going to spawn there but that's what I", 'do I throw all these down I broke the', "egg open I'm going to pick that back up", "and then I'm going to go to wherever the", 'closest cluster of uh things are so this', 'little area right here this is where',

many spawns', 'there are since I activated all six and', 'all six are still functioning I get Max', 'spawns if you go and activate all of', 'them and then destroy all of them but', 'one of them you get significantly lower', 'spawns just got a ton of zombies right', 'there so since all these little spawn', "points are so close to me and I'm I'm in", 'the middle of all of them the game will',

and', 'we should have the money I also drop all', 'these annoying things out of my', "inventory I don't like them we can go", 'and start uh completing the contract now', 'cuz by the time we go and uh actually', 'destroy all these we should kill enough', 'zombies all right we go and destroy the', 'Spore now usually I if I would just stay', 'there all game for most of my challenges', "but since we have to go into tier 2 it's", 'a whole different story so before it was', 'spawning at least like 20 plus now we', 'got 1 2 3 4 5 6 always a massive', 'decrease whenever you actually destroy', 'them like that Crystal Crystal no', "unlucky all right let's go to this pack", 'over here now we want to try and find an', "Outlast thing in tier 2 there's one all", 'the way over here [\xa0__\xa0] me is there one', "anywhere else no there's just this one", "1,400 away I don't have that much time", "but I'm thinking that it'll spawn pretty", 'quickly the objective is to get the tier', '2 like strong

increases a', 'spawn rate what if I just stay outside', "of it and don't increase a spawn rate", "well I still get Elite spawns there's", 'dogs okay I mean the zombies go down', "very easily I haven't seen any Elites", 'yet okay I got to stand in here okay', 'maybe I can get them to come through in', 'Just One Direction over here yeah and', "they're going to make their way up", "instead of throwing [\xa0__\xa0] at me that's my", "assumption I'm going to stand in here", 'they said above 50 to like 70% oh', "disciple that's under", '50% but I got it I just got to remember', "to make sure that I don't stay in here", 'too long yeah another disciple it', 'actually works wow another disciple okay', "I'm going to get out of here let the uh", 'progress go back down I need the', 'disciple kill not you Mangler get the', 'dog get the disciple get these guys out', 'of my', 'face is it discipled I got it I', 'completed it and oh yes and I only got a', 'rare ather tool out of that amazing game',

even", "need to be here anymore so we're going", 'to go and try to find a nice easy', 'contract on the outside now either', "spores or outlasts there's a Spore over", "here they say this isn't a PVP mode but", 'the amount of people that sit here and', 'fight and steal [\xa0__\xa0] contracts and', "kills from people it's egregious I could", 'have gotten 100 zombie kills there', 'instead of worrying about going and', 'getting that contract but this is just', 'how I do it all right boom all right', "they're all activated I'm going to run", 'back through and grab all of them up so', 'nobody can walk by and steal [\xa0__\xa0] from', 'me given I only need 100 so I I doubt', 'anybody would come by and actually', 'destroy all of them I got plenty of time', 'but finally this one is gold like these', 'weapons I I know now that I could', 'definitely do the tier 2 thing that was', 'the most consistent spawn I had ever', "seen the other ones where like there's", 'certain locations on the map and stuff', 'like that where they could spawn like I', 'always would go there and they would', 'just never be there now the zombes', 'should be coming I should get a big', 'massive spawn of zombies now from the', 'point of completing that challenge now I', 'need 100 zombies kills so once you go', 'and complete your fourth challenge in', 'game you now have to do your fifth camos',

fixes', 'out so there used to be a thing where it', 'would bug and then you basically had to', 'go into the game with like no', "attachments you couldn't Pack-a-Punch", "and all this other [\xa0__\xa0] but I haven't", "had an issue since that point okay I'm", "just going to go if it's not 100 and", "it's like 99 I'm going", 'to all right that should count right we', 'should get the gold camo and we should', 'get the other one beautiful yep it', 'worked boom there it is gold and then we', 'got the final one over here the breu', 'going to put the 200 belt mag on', 'here oh yeah this thing right here is', 'crazy it completely eliminates your', 'vertical recoil it goes crazy same thing', "with a purifier let's go and check on", "the challenges here I mean it can't be", 'as annoying as that apparently I already', 'got 250 kills with the bruan somehow uh', 'we need rare or higher Rarity having at', 'least four perks this is another one', "that's kind of annoying and fire damage", 'I have a fire damage thing getting at', 'least four perks is also kind of', 'annoying and a little bit stressful cuz', "I don't fill my inventory with a bunch", 'of extra perks over in my gear [\xa0__\xa0] I', 'usually just got tools and mods and', 'stuff but at least I got two of the', 'tools that I need right here right I', 'need fire damage and at least regular', 'Rarity spawn into the game pop this pop', 'the fire damage one these two will', 'immediately be count and then I just', 'need to get 250 kills as soon as I get', 'the four perks need to note it in my', 'brain once that pops up then I need to', "do the 100 after you guys get it it's", "the same flow it's honestly you don't", 'have to think that much once you', 'actually get into the flow of it it', 'sounds like a lot
