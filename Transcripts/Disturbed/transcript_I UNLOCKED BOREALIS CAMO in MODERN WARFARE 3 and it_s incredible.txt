covered', 'in like not so goodlooking colors', 'speaking of colors and [\xa0__\xa0] how does', "this look in the dark okay this isn't", 'even the darkest corner that I can find', 'and this [\xa0__\xa0] is just glowing this is', 'one of the darker ones that I can find', 'on the map but holy [\xa0__\xa0] yeah and it', 'looks great with the charm as well cuz', "it's got some of like the green turquo", 'man they really do look more detailed', 'when you put on depth of field as well', 'really exaggerates how sharp it looks', "very very clean for sure I'm definitely", 'going to like if I was playing', "multiplayer right now like if I didn't", "do bioluminescent I'd probably be", 'running around with like a Borealis', 'primary just to like Flex a little bit', 'on the MP guy and then have the inter', 'Cellar secondary but a noticeable', 'secondary like a launcher or some [\xa0__\xa0] I', 'bet it looks even better on zombies as', 'well the issue is that if I go into', 'zombies
